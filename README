            a screen saver and locker for the X window system
                            by Jamie Zawinski

To build on Unix:

  -  ./configure
  -  make
  -  make install

The `configure' shell script will attempt to figure out which options are
appropriate for your system, and will create config.h and the various
Makefiles for you.  Run `configure --help' to see how to override these
choices, or to specify things like the default installation directory.
The file `INSTALL' gives a general overview of use of these sorts of
configure scripts (those generated by the GNU autoconf system.)
The most important hint is probably this:

   ./configure --includedir=/opt/Motif/include --libdir=/opt/Motif/lib

To build on VMS, see README.VMS.

                              ============

The xscreensaver program waits until the keyboard and mouse have been idle
for a period, and then runs a graphics demo chosen at random.  It turns off
as soon as there is any mouse or keyboard activity.

The purpose of xscreensaver is to display pretty pictures on your screen 
when it is not in use, in keeping with the philosophy that unattended 
monitors should always be doing something interesting, just like they do 
in the movies.

However, xscreensaver can also be used as a screen locker, to prevent
others from using your terminal while your are away.

The benefit that this program has over the combination of the xlock and
xautolock programs is the ease with which new graphics hacks can be
installed: you don't need to recompile this program to add a new display
mode, you just change some resource settings.  Any program which can be
invoked in such a way that it draws on the root window of the screen can
now be used as a screensaver without modification.  The programs that
are being run as screensavers don't need to have any special knowledge
about what it means to be a screensaver.

The XIDLE, MIT-SCREEN-SAVER, and/or SGI SCREEN_SAVER server extensions
will be used if you have them.

The dialog boxes (for locking and demo-mode) look best using Motif, but
can be configured to use Athena widgets instead.

Also included are several graphics hacks for use as screensavers.  There's
nothing magic about these: they're just programs that draw on the root
window, which are pointed at by the screensaver's default resource settings.

   qix		- My own implementation of this, with many more options
		  than you would have thought qix could have.
   helix	- Generates spirally "stringart" patterns.
   pedal	- Draws a different kind of spirally pattern.
   rorschach	- Random inkblot patterns.
   attraction	- A bouncing ball demo, or a qix-like demo, or a wild
		  color-cycling thing, with some odd rules.
   greynetic	- Random colored/stippled rectangles.
   rocks	- Flying through an asteroid field.
   blitspin	- Rotate a bitmap using bitblts.
   imsmap	- Generates random maps or cloud formations.
   hypercube	- 2d projection of a hypercube rotating on all four axes.
   slidescreen	- Divides the screen into a grid and plays a 16-puzzle on it.
   decayscreen	- A melting effect.
   halo		- Random circular patterns.
   pyro		- Fireworks.  Looks a lot like the version in xlock.
   hopalong	- Fractals.  I snarfed this code from xlock.
   flame	- Fractals.  Also from xlock.
   noseguy	- A guy with a big nose wanders around the screen saying
		  things.  I snarfed this code from xnlock.
   maze		- This is the X maze demo modified to take a -root option
		  so that it works with xscreensaver.
   lmorph	- morphing line drawings.
   bubbles	- condensation forms on your monitor, then pops.
   deco		- Generates Brady-Bunch-era wall paneling.
   moire	- Circular interference patterns.
   kaleidescope	- Groovy, man.
   swirl	- Swirly color-cycling patterns.
   bouboule	- Spinning bubbles on a transparent ball.
   braid	- Draws random color-cycling braids around a circle.
   drift	- Drifting recursive fractal cosmic flames.
   fract	- Small, curvy geometric patterns.
   galaxy	- Spinning, colliding galaxies.
   grav		- Orbital simulation and/or cloud chamber.
   ifs		- Spinning, colliding iterated-function-system shapes.
   julia	- Animated rendition of the Julia set.
   laser	- Moving radiating lines.
   lightning	- Crackling fractal lightning bolts.
   penrose	- Quasiperiodic tilings.
   sierpinski	- two-dimensional Sierpinski triangle.
   slip		- Sucks your desktop through a jet engine.
   spiral	- Circular color-cycling interference patterns.
   strange	- Animating strange attractors.
   flag		- A waving flag of an arbitrary bitmap or text.
   sphere	- draw a bunch of shaded spheres.
   forest	- grows a fractal forest.
   lisa		- draws animated full-loop lisajous figures.
   goop		- Squishy transparent oil-and-bubble images
   starfish	- Radially-symmetric throbbing colormap-hacking blobs.
   munch	- The classic 1962-vintage "munching squares" hack.
   rd-bomb      - Reaction-diffusion fractals.
   coral        - Simulation of coral growth, sort of.
   fadeplot	- Draws a swimming ribbon.
   escher	- Draws some escher-like scenes (GLX only.)
   gears	- Draws interlocking rotating gears (GLX only.)
   morph3d	- Draws shiny shape-changing 3d forms (GLX only.)
   superquadrics - More shiny shape-changing 3d forms (GLX only.)
   pipes	- Generates a field of intertwined plumbing (GLX only.)
   rubik	- Solves a Rubik's Cube (GLX only.)
   sproingies	- Marble Madness meets Q-Bert (GLX only.)

All of these will pop up their own window unless given that -root option.
See their man pages for more details.

Other reasonable things to use as screensavers, if you have them, are

  xdaliclock -root -builtin2	- melting digital clock
  xswarm -r 2>&-		- swimming sperm
  xwave -root			- random 3d graphs
  xbouncebits			- bounce arbitrary bitmaps around
  ico -r -p8 -faces -sleep 1	- it's dull, but it's there
  xv -root file.gif -quit	- they don't all have to animate!
  xsplinefun			- bouncing splines
  xfishtank -c black -d -r 1	- fish (use version 2.0 or later)
  xtacy -root			- various eye candy
  /usr/demos/bin/bongo -wbongo	- an SGI GL demo

You can get all of these from the contrib directory on ftp.x.org.  If you
know of (or write) any other interesting programs that can be used as
screensavers, please let me know!
