.TH XScreenSaver 1 "22-Nov-98 (3.06)" "X Version 11"
.SH NAME
xscreensaver-demo - interactively control the background xscreensaver daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xscreensaver\-demo
[\-display \fIhost:display.screen\fP] [\-prefs] [\-xrm \fIresources\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIxscreensaver\-demo\fP program is a graphical front-end for 
setting the parameters used by the background
.BR xscreensaver (1)
daemon.
It is essentially two things: a tool for editing the \fI~/.xscreensaver\fP
file; and a tool for demoing the various graphics hacks that 
the \fIxscreensaver\fP daemon will launch.

The main dialog box contains a scrolling list, a text field, and a number 
of buttons.  

Double-clicking on one of the programs in the list will run it.  The screen
will go black, and the program will run in full-screen mode, just as it would
if the \fIxscreensaver\fP daemon had launched it.  Clicking the mouse again
will stop the demo and un-blank the screen, making the dialog box visible 
again.

Single-clicking in the list will place the indicated program and its args
in the text field to be edited.  Edit the arguments and hit return to run
the program with the parameters you have specified.  This will also save
your changes to your \fI~/.xscreensaver\fP file: so any changes you make
in this way are persistent.

If one of the lines in the scrolling list begins with the character "-",
then that means that the program is disabled: \fIxscreensaver\fP will not
select it to be run (though you can still try it out by clicking on it.)
Rather than just deleting the programs you don't want to run, you might
want to disable them in this way instead, so that you can more easily change
your mind later.

If the line begins with the name of a visual, followed by a colon, then
that program will only be run on that kind of visual.  For example, you can
specify that a particular program should only be run if color is available,
and another should only be run in monochrome.  See the discussion of 
the \fIprograms\fP parameter in the \fIConfiguration\fP section of the
.BR xscreensaver (1)
manual.

The buttons are:
.TP 8
.B Run Next
Clicking this button will run the next program in the list after the 
currently-selected one, and will wrap around to the top when it reaches
the bottom.
.TP 8
.B Run Previous
Opposite of Run Next; at the top, it wraps around to the bottom.
.TP 8
.B Preferences
This pops up a second dialog box, in which you have the option to 
interactively change most of the screensaver's operational parameters,
such as its timeouts, and whether it should lock the screen.  When you
click OK, your chosen settings will take effect immediately, and will
also be saved to the \fI~/.xscreensaver\fP file in your home directory,
so that the settings will persist next time.
.TP 8
.B Quit
Exits the \fIxscreensaver-demo\fP program.  The background \fIxscreensaver\fP
daemon will continue running as before.
.P
The Preferences dialog box lets you change the following settings.

(There are more settings available, but these are the most commonly used
ones; see the manual for
.BR xscreensaver (1)
for other parameters that can be set by editing the \fI~/.xscreensaver\fP
file, or the X resource database.)
.TP 8
.B Saver Timeout
After the user has been idle this long, the \fIxscreensaver\fP daemon
will blank the screen.
.TP 8
.B Cycle Timeout
After the screensaver has been running for this long, the currently
running graphics demo will be killed, and a new one started.  
If this is 0, then the graphics demo will never be changed:
only one demo will run until the screensaver is deactivated by user 
activity.
.TP 8
.B Verbose\ 
Whether to print lots of debugging information.
.TP 8
.B Install Colormap
Whether to install a private colormap while the screensaver is active, so
that the graphics hacks can get as many colors as possible.  (This only
applies when the screen's default visual is being used, since non-default
visuals get their own colormaps automatically.)  This can also be overridden
on a per-demo basis.
.TP 8
.B Fade Colormap
If selected, then when the screensaver activates, the current contents
of the screen will fade to black instead of simply winking out.  This only
works on displays with writable colormaps, that is, if the screen's default
visual is a PseudoColor visual.  A fade will also be done when
switching graphics hacks (when the \fICycle Timeout\fP expires.)
.TP 8
.B Unfade Colormap
The complement to \fIFade Colormap\fP: if selected, then when the screensaver
deactivates, the original contents of the screen will fade in from black
instead of appearing immediately.  This only works on displays with writable
colormaps, and when \fIFade Colormap\fP is also selected.
.TP 8
.B Fade Duration
When fading or unfading are selected, this controls how long the fade will
take.
.TP 8
.B Fade Ticks
This controls how many times a second the colormap will be changed to 
effect a fade.  Higher numbers yield smoother fades, but may make the
fades take longer than the specified number of seconds, if your server
isn't fast enough to keep up.
.TP 8
.B Require Password
Whether the screen saver should lock the screen when it activates.
.TP 8
.B Lock Timeout
If \fIRequire Password\fP is selected, this controls the length of 
the ``grace period'' between when the screensaver activates, and when the
screen becomes locked.  For example, if this is 0:05:00, 
and \fISaver Timeout\fP is 0:10:00, then after 10 minutes, the screen 
would blank.  If there was user  activity at 12 minutes, no password
would be required to un-blank the screen.  But, if there was user activity
at 15 minutes or later (that is, \fILock Timeout\fP minutes after 
activation) then a password would be required.  The default is 0, meaning
that if locking is enabled, then a password will be required as soon as the 
screen blanks.
.TP 8
.B Password Timeout
When the screensaver is prompting for a password, the prompt dialog box will
stay on the screen for this long before giving up, and reverting to 
screen-saving mode.
.SH COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
.I xscreensaver\-demo
accepts the following command line options.
.TP 8
.B \-display \fIhost:display.screen\fP
The X display to use.  The \fIxscreensaver\-demo\fP program will open its
window on that display, and also control the \fIxscreensaver\fP daemon that
is managing that same display.
.TP 8
.B \-prefs
Start up in Preferences mode: this is just like launching the program with
no arguments, and then pressing the \fIPreferences\fP button.
.P
It is important that the \fIxscreensaver\fP and \fIxscreensaver\-demo\fP
processes be running on the same machine, or at least, on two machines
that share a file system.  When \fIxscreensaver\-demo\fP writes a new version
of the \fI~/.xscreensaver\fP file, it's important that the \fIxscreensaver\fP
see that same file.  If the two processes are seeing 
different \fI~/.xscreensaver\fP files, things will malfunction.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B PATH
to find the sub-programs to run.  However, note that the sub-programs 
are actually launched by the \fIxscreensaver\fP daemon, not 
by \fIxscreensaver-demo\fP itself.  So, what matters is what \fB$PATH\fP
the \fIxscreensaver\fP program sees.
.TP 8
.B HOME
for the directory in which to read and write the \fI.xscreensaver\fP file.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
