"*hacks.qix.documentation:						\
This is the swiss army chainsaw of qix programs.  It bounces a series	\
of line segments around the screen, and uses variations on this basic	\
motion pattern to produce all sorts of different presentations: line	\
segments, filled polygons, overlapping translucent areas...  Written	\
by Jamie Zawinski.",
"*hacks.attraction.documentation:					\
Like qix, this uses a simple simple motion model to generate many	\
different display modes.  The control points attract each other up to	\
a certain distance, and then begin to repel each other.	 The		\
attraction/repulsion is proportional to the distance between any two	\
particles, similar to the strong and weak nuclear forces.		\
								    \\n\\n\
One of the most interesting ways to watch this hack is simply as	\
bouncing balls, because their motions and interactions with each	\
other are so odd.  Sometimes two balls will get into a tight orbit	\
around each other, to be interrupted later by a third, or by the edge	\
of the screen.	It looks quite chaotic.					\
								    \\n\\n\
Written by Jamie Zawinski, based on Lisp code by John Pezaris.",

"*hacks.helix.documentation:						\
This repeatedly generates spirally string-art-ish patterns.  Written	\

"*hacks.pedal.documentation:						\
This is sort of a combination spirograph/string-art.  It generates a	\
large, complex polygon, and lets the X server do the bulk of the work	\
by giving it an even/odd winding rule.	Written by Dale Moore, based	\
on some ancient PDP-11 code.",
"*hacks.rorschach.documentation:						\
This generates random inkblot patterns.	 The algorithm is deceptively	\
simple for how well it works; it merely walks a dot around the screen	\
randomly, and then reflects the image horizontally, vertically, or	\
both.  Any deep-seated neurotic tendencies which this program reveals	\
are your own problem.  Written by Jamie Zawinski.",
"*hacks.hopalong.documentation:						\
This draws lacy fractal patterns, based on iteration in the imaginary	\
plane, from a 1986 Scientific American article.	 Mostly written by	\
Patrick Naughton.",
"*hacks.greynetic.documentation:						\

Zawinski.",
"*hacks.xroger.documentation:						\
The XScreenSaver logo. Don't you hate it?  So do I.  Would you like	\
to design a new logo for XScreenSaver?	If so, send jwz your		\
submissions.",
"*hacks.imsmap.name: IMSmap",
"*hacks.imsmap.documentation:						\
This generates random cloud-like patterns.  It looks quite different	\
in monochrome and color.  The basic idea is to take four points on	\
the edge of the image, and assign each a random ``elevation''.	Then	\
find the point between them, and give it a value which is the average	\
of the other four, plus some small random offset. Then coloration is	\
done based on elevation.						\
								    \\n\\n\
The color selection is done by binding the elevation to either hue,	\
saturation, or brightness, and assigning random values to the others.	\
The ``brightness'' mode tends to yield cloudlike patterns, and the	\
others tend to generate images that look like heat-maps or CAT-scans.	\
Written by Juergen Nickelsen and Jamie Zawinski.",
"*hacks.slidescreen.name: SlideScreen",
"*hacks.slidescreen.documentation:					\
This grabs an image of whatever is on your screen, divides it into a	\
grid, and then randomly shuffles the squares around as if it was one	\
of those annoying ``16-puzzle'' games, where there is a grid of		\
squares, one of which is missing.  I hate trying to solve those		\
puzzles, but watching one permute itself is more amusing.  Written by	\
Jamie Zawinski.",
"*hacks.decayscreen.name: DecayScreen",
"*hacks.decayscreen.documentation:					\
This grabs an image of whatever is on your screen, and makes it melt.	\
You've no doubt seen this effect before, but no screensaver would	\
really be complete without it.	It works best if there's something	\
colorful visible.  Warning, if the effect continues after the screen	\
saver is off, seek medical attention.  Written by David Wald and	\
Vivek Khera.								\
								    \\n\\n\
A number of these screenhacks have the ability to take an image of	\
your desktop and manipulate it in some way.  On SGI systems, these	\
programs are able to (at random) pull their source image from the	\
system's video input instead!  This works nicely if you leave some	\
some random television station plugged in.",
"*hacks.jigsaw.documentation:						\
This grabs a screen image, carves it up into a jigsaw puzzle,		\
shuffles it, and then solves the puzzle.  This works especially well	\
when you feed it an external video signal instead of letting it grab	\
the screen image (actually, I guess this is generally true...)	When	\
it is grabbing a video image, it is sometimes pretty hard to guess	\
what the image is going to look like once the puzzle is solved.		\
Written by Jamie Zawinski.",
"*hacks.blitspin.name: BlitSpin",
"*hacks.blitspin.documentation:						\
The ``blitspin'' hack repeatedly rotates a bitmap by 90 degrees by	\
using logical operations: the bitmap is divided into quadrants, and	\
the quadrants are shifted clockwise.  Then the same thing is done	\
again with progressively smaller quadrants, except that all		\
sub-quadrants of a given size are rotated in parallel.	Written by	\
Jamie Zawinski based on some cool SmallTalk code seen in in Byte	\
Magazine in 1981.							\
								    \\n\\n\
As you watch it, the image appears to dissolve into static and then	\
reconstitute itself, but rotated. You can provide the image to use,	\
as an XBM or XPM file, or tell it to grab a screen image and rotate	\
that.",
"*hacks.slip.documentation:						\
This program throws some random bits on the screen, then sucks them	\
through a jet engine and spews them out the other side.	 To avoid	\
turning the image completely to mush, every now and then it will and	\
then it interjects some splashes of color into the scene, or go into	\
a spin cycle, or stretch the image like taffy, or (this is my		\
addition) grab an image of your current desktop to chew on.		\
Originally written by Scott Draves; whacked on by Jamie Zawinski.",

Draws a spotlight scanning across a black screen, illumnating the	\
underlying desktop when it passes.  Written by Rick Schultz.",
"*hacks.hypercube.documentation:						\
This displays 2D projections of the sequence of 3D objects which are	\
the projections of the 4D analog to the cube: as a square is composed	\
of four lines, each touching two others; and a cube is composed of	\
six squares, each touching four others; a hypercube is composed of	\
eight cubes, each touching six others.	To make it easier to		\
visualize the rotation, it uses a different color for the edges of	\
each face.  Don't think about it too long, or your brain will melt.	\
Written by Joe Keane, Fritz Mueller, and Jamie Zawinski.",

This draws trippy psychedelic circular patterns that hurt to look at.	\
It can also animate the control-points, but that takes a lot of CPU	\

This is the ancient X maze demo, modified to work with xscreensaver.	\
It generates a random maze, then solves it with visual feedback.	\
Originally by Jim Randell; modified by a cast of thousands.",
"*hacks.noseguy.documentation:						\
A little man with a big nose wanders around your screen saying		\
things.	 The things which he says can come from a file, or from an	\

"*hacks.moire.documentation:						\
This one draws cool circular interference patterns.  Most of the	\
circles you see aren't explicitly rendered, but show up as a result	\
of interactions between the other pixels that were drawn.  Written by	\
Jamie Zawinski, inspired by Java code by Michael Bayne.	 As he		\
pointed out, the beauty of this one is that the heart of the display	\
algorithm can be expressed with just a pair of loops and a handful of	\
arithmetic, giving it a high ``display hack metric''.",
"*hacks.moire2.documentation:						\
Another example of the fun you can have with moire			\
interference patterns; this hack generates fields of concentric		\
circles or ovals, and combines the planes with various operations.	\
The planes are moving independently of one another, causing the		\
interference lines to ``spray.''  Written by Jamie Zawinski.",

In April 1997, Sir Roger Penrose, a British math professor who has	\
worked with Stephen Hawking on such topics as relativity, black		\
holes, and whether time has a beginning, filed a			\
copyright-infringement lawsuit against the Kimberly-Clark		\
Corporation, which Penrose said copied a pattern he created (a		\
pattern demonstrating that ``a nonrepeating pattern could exist in	\
nature'') for its Kleenex quilted toilet paper.	Penrose said he		\
doesn't like litigation but, ``When it comes to the population of	\
Great Britain being invited by a multinational to wipe their bottoms	\
on what appears to be the work of a Knight of the Realm, then a last	\
stand must be taken.''							\
