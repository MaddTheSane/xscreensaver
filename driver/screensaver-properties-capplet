# The existence of this script in /usr/bin/ forces Gnome to use the
# xscreensaver-demo program (instead of the lame Gnome code) to launch,
# initialize, and configure xscreensaver.  When running in crapplet mode,
# xscreensaver-demo accepts the same arguments that Gnome's capplet does,
# except that "--capplet" must be the first argument.

exec xscreensaver-demo --capplet "$@"
