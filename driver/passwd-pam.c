/* PAM sucks in that there is no way to tell whether a particular service
   is configured at all.  That is, there is no way to tell the difference
   between "authentication of the FOO service is not allowed" and "the
   user typed the wrong password."

   On RedHat 5.1 systems, if a service name is not known, it defaults to
   being not allowed (because the fallback service, /etc/pam.d/other, is
   set to `pam_deny'.)

   On Solaris 2.6 systems, unknown services default to authenticating normally.

   So, we could simply require that the person who installs xscreensaver
   set up an "xscreensaver" PAM service.  However, if we went that route,
   it would have a really awful failure mode: the failure mode would be that
   xscreensaver was willing to *lock* the screen, but would be unwilling to
   *unlock* the screen.  (With the non-PAM password code, the analagous
   situation -- security not being configured properly, for example do to the
   executable not being installed as setuid root -- the failure mode is much
   more palettable, in that xscreensaver will refuse to *lock* the screen,
   because it can know up front that there is no password that will work.)

   Another route would be to have the service name to consult be computed at
   compile-time (perhaps with a configure option.)  However, that doesn't
   really solve the problem, because it means that the same executable might
   work fine on one machine, but refuse to unlock when run on another
   machine.

   Another alternative would be to look in /etc/pam.conf or /etc/pam.d/ at
   runtime to see what services actually exist.  But I think that's no good,
   because who is to say that the PAM info is actually specified in those
   files?  Opening and reading those files is not a part of the PAM client
   API, so it's not guarenteed to work on any given system.

   An alternative I tried was to specify a list of services to try, and to
   try them all in turn ("xscreensaver", "xlock", "xdm", and "login").
   This worked, but it was slow (and I also had to do some contortions to
   work around bugs in Linux PAM 0.64-3.)

   So what we do today is, try PAM once, and if that fails, try the usual
   getpwent() method.  So if PAM doesn't work, it will at least make an
   attempt at looking up passwords in /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow instead.

   This all kind of blows.  I'm not sure what else to do.

   first, and then this function simply returns the result that has been
   typed.

   This means that if PAM was using a retina scanner for auth, xscreensaver
