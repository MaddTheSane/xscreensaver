.TH XScreenSaver 1 "15-Apr-2001 (3.32)" "X Version 11"
.SH NAME
xscreensaver-getimage - put some randomly-selected image on the root window
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xscreensaver-getimage
[\-display \fIhost:display.screen\fP] [\--verbose] window-id
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIxscreensaver\-getimage\fP program is a helper program for the
xscreensaver hacks that manipulate images.  This is not a user-level
command.

This program selects a random image, and puts it on the specified
window.  This image might be a snapshot of the desktop; or a frame
captured from the system's video input; or a randomly-selected image
from disk.
.SH OPTIONS
.I xscreensaver-getimage
reads the \fI~/.xscreensaver\fP file for configuration information.
It uses these settings:
.TP 4
.B grabDesktopImages
Whether it is acceptable to grab snapshots of the desktop.
The security paranoid might want to turn this off, to avoid letting
people see (but not touch!) your desktop while the screen is locked.
.TP 4
.B grabVideoFrames
Whether it is acceptable to grab frames of video from the system's video
input.  Grabbing of video is done by invoking the
.BR xscreensaver-getimage-video (1)
program.
.TP 4
.B chooseRandomImages
Whether it is acceptable to display random images found on disk.
Selection and loading of images is done by invoking the
.BR xscreensaver-getimage-file (1)
program.
.TP 4
.B imageDirectory
When loading images from disk, this is the directory to search.
The directory will be searched recursively, and all files in it are 
assumed to be images.
.PP
If none of the three options are set to True, then video
colorbars will be displayed instead.
.SH BUGS
If the target window is not the root window, then this program 
will \fIalways\fP grab a desktop image.  This means that if an 
image-manipulating xscreensaver mode is run in a normal window,
it will always operate on a desktop image; it's only when it is
run in \fI-root\fP mode (or when invoked by xscreensaver) that
it will load image files or grab video.
