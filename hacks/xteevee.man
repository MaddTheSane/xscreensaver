.SH DESCRIPTION
.I xteevee
simulates various television problems, fondly re-creating the days when
computers were fun and I spent my time with an Atari 400 hooked up to a
black-and-white TV I found in someone's trash.
.PP
When run,
.I xteevee
picks a mode to display from the available options.  If modes are explicitly
set on the command-line, they over-ride the implicit options and will be
choosen among exclusively.  If modes are explicitly excluded from the
command-line, the they are simply removed from contention.

.SH X RESOURCES
Notable X resources supported include the following:

.BR static,
.BR roll
and
.BR bars
are booleans, defining which modes are to be implicitly available if
.I xteevee
is run without command-line mode selections.
.BR cycle
is a boolean, defining if
.I xteevee
should cycle through each available mode or pick one and stick with it.
.BR delayMode
and

are integers, defining how long each mode should be displayed and how
long the time between them should be if
.BR cycle
is on.
