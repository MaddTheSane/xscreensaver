This takes an image, divides it into a grid, and then randomly shuffles
the squares around as if it was one of those annoying ``16-puzzle''
games, where there is a grid of squares, one of which is missing.
I hate trying to solve those puzzles, but watching one permute itself
is more amusing.  Written by Jamie Zawinski.
