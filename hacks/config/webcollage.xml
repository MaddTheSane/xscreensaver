This program makes collages out of random images pulled off of the
World Wide Web.  It finds these images by doing random web searches,
and then extracting images from the returned pages.  It can also be set
up to filter the images through the `VidWhacker' program, above, which
looks really great.

(Note that most of the images it finds are text, and not pictures.
This is because most of the web is pictures of text.  Which is pretty
sad.)  Written by Jamie Zawinski.
