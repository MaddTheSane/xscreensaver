  <_description>
The ``blitspin'' hack repeatedly rotates a bitmap by 90 degrees by
using logical operations: the bitmap is divided into quadrants, and
the quadrants are shifted clockwise.  Then the same thing is done
again with progressively smaller quadrants, except that all
sub-quadrants of a given size are rotated in parallel.  Written by
Jamie Zawinski based on some cool SmallTalk code seen in in Byte
Magazine in 1981.

As you watch it, the image appears to dissolve into static and then
reconstitute itself, but rotated. You can provide the image to use,
as an XBM or XPM file, or tell it to grab a screen image and rotate
that.
