Simulates an original Apple ][ Plus computer in all its 1979 glory.  It
also reproduces the appearance of display on a color television set of
the period.

In "Text Mode", it displays the output of a command (e.g., "fortune".)

In "Slideshow Mode", it chooses a number of images from the image
source you configured into XScreenSaver and displays them within the
limitations of the Apple ][ display hardware.  (Six available colors
in hi-res mode!)

In "Basic Programming Mode", a simulated user types in a BASIC program
and runs it.
