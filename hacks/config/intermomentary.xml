The Intersection Momentary is a fun visualization defining the relationships 
between objects with Casey Reas, William Ngan, and Robert Hodgin. Commissioned 
for display at the Whitney Museum of American Art.

A surface filled with 100 medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a 
different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. Display:
    A. The instantaneous intersections of the circles.
    B. The aggregate intersections of the circles.
