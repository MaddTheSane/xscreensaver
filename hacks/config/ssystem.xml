SSystem is a GL Solar System simulator.  It simulates flybys of Sun,
the nine planets and a few major satellites, with four camera modes.
Written by Raul Alonso.  This is not included with the XScreenSaver
package, but if you don't have it already, you can find it at
&lt;http://www1.las.es/~amil/ssystem/&gt;.

Note: this program doesn't work as a screen saver on all systems,
because it doesn't communicate with xscreensaver properly.  It happens
to work with some window managers, but not with others, so your 
mileage may vary.
