SSystem is a GL Solar System simulator.  It simulates flybys of Sun,
the nine planets and a few major satellites, with four camera modes.
Written by Raul Alonso.  This is not included with the XScreenSaver
package, but is packaged separately.

Note: SSystem does not work as a screen saver on all systems, because
it doesn't communicate with xscreensaver properly.  It happens to work
with some window managers, but not with others, so your mileage may
vary.

SSystem was once available at &lt;http://www1.las.es/~amil/ssystem/&gt;,
but is now gone.  You may still be able to find copies elsewhere.

SSystem has since evolved into Celestia, found at
&lt;http://www.shatters.net/celestia/&gt;.  Sadly, Celestia does not work
with xscreensaver at all.  You are encouraged to nag the authors into
adding xscreensaver support!
