This one draws spinning, animating (are you detecting a pattern here
yet?)  explorations of the Julia set. You've probably seen static
images of this fractal form before, but it's a lot of fun to watch in
motion as well.  One interesting thing is that there is a small
swinging dot passing in front of the image, which indicates the
control point from which the rest of the image was generated.
